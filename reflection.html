<h1>Reflection</h1>
<p>Overall my experience learning web development was a challenging but yet fun experience. Web development is a very beautiful topic, web developers have many responsibilities since web developers are specialist software engineers who use their technical ability and creative vision to develop web applications, such as content management systems, e-commerce solutions and other bespoke web-based products. Furthermore web developers are a unique breed, and the development projects in which they work on have a various key differences. For instance, web developers develop their products on a web server and use a web browser as a graphical user interface (GUI). I also find it amazing and also inspirational that web developers also need to think about cross-browser compatibility, i.e. how the web application will function across various different browsers, such as Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Opera and Safari. During lectures I learn't that being a web developer takes skill and patience due to the fact their is some situations which are very complex and you may not be able to work you way around them straight away, but by doing the correct amount of research you can overcome and solve these problems. Below is evidence for the validation of the website.

  <p>Above is a wireframe which me and the team drew in order to plan the layout of how every page was going to be. We decided to go with the conventional website look which has the hyperlinks at the top, the footer at the bottom followed by a background in the middle of the page.</p>
