<h1>Web Developer Vs Game Developer</h1>
<p>On this page I will be doing comparison between the job titles 'Web Development' and 'Game Development'</p>
<p>Firstly in web development the skills are more portable, the employment is more steady and there is more opportunity for growth as a career. Game development, while technically incredibly challenging, suffers from a "death march" work ethic that trades
    on the psychology of working on cool stuff to extort your labor from you at cut-rate prices and then toss you aside when things don't work out.




</p>
<p>Whereas being a game developer is more of a hobby than an actual job role. Game developers, often referred to as video game developers or video game designers, are software developers and engineers who create video games. Game developers may be involved in various aspects of a game's creation from concept and story writing to the coding and programming.</p>
