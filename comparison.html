    <h1>Web Developer Vs Game Developer</h1>
    <p>On this page I will be doing comparison between the job titles 'Web Development' and 'Game Development'</p>
    <p>Firstly in web development the skills are more portable, the employment is more steady and there is more opportunity for growth as a career.  Game development, while technically incredibly challenging, suffers from a "death march" work ethic that trades on the psychology of working on cool stuff to extort your labor from you at cut-rate prices and then toss you aside when things don't work out.

<p>Whereas being a game developer is more of a hobby than an actual job role</p>
